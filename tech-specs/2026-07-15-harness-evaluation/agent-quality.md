# Harness agent-quality E2E

Agent-quality E2E evaluates whether a pinned model, prompt, function catalog,
worker set, and harness build can complete representative user workflows. It
uses the production router/provider path, validates durable outcomes, and
reports quality, reliability, latency, token use, and cost without compressing
them into an opaque score.

## Definition

The first implementation is one dedicated `harness-eval` worker with internal
modules for orchestration, validation, evidence, and reports. A thin CLI or CI
launcher loads a strict scenario manifest, starts a run, and collects the
report. Splitting those modules into separate workers requires a measured
scaling or permission need.

The evaluator is deliberately separate from two adjacent systems:

- [HarnessBench PR #280](https://github.com/iii-hq/workers/pull/280) remains a
  same-prompt performance comparison product with its own run record and UI.
- [`workflow`](../../workflow/README.md) remains a production DAG orchestrator
  and may be evaluated as a subject. Evaluation does not extend its node model.

`harness::react` is also not an evaluator. It is a lightweight event-to-agent
bridge without the experiment record, validation protocol, retries, or report
aggregation required here ([`harness/src/functions/react.rs:1`](../../harness/src/functions/react.rs)).

## Decisions

| Area | Version 1 decision |
|---|---|
| Execution owner | One `harness-eval` worker with a durable run record |
| Entry point | `harness::send`; never `harness::turn` |
| Completion | Global evaluator binding to `harness::turn-completed`, plus status reconciliation |
| Continuation | A new `harness::send` in the same session after terminal state |
| Manifest | Strict YAML parsed into a versioned JSON shape; unknown fields rejected |
| Validators | Provided validators may gate; agent-authored validators are experimental |
| Grading | Required deterministic checks plus raw dimensions; no composite score |
| Artifacts | Local run directory in v1, uploaded by CI according to result policy |
| Isolation | Dedicated evaluation stack in CI and explicitly scoped fixtures |

## Goals

1. Evaluate real workflows through the same harness, router, provider, and
   function boundaries used in production.
2. Make outcome correctness independent from the subject agent's own claims.
3. Compare a candidate and baseline with pinned inputs and visible raw metrics.
4. Survive duplicate, missing, and out-of-order completion notifications.
5. Bound feedback cycles, time, tokens, network activity, and cost.
6. Retain enough evidence to explain every non-pass classification.

## Boundaries

- This is not deterministic harness conformance; that track controls the model
  boundary and is specified in [conformance-e2e.md](conformance-e2e.md).
- It does not require exact function trajectories when several valid solutions
  exist.
- It does not permit a model grader to override a required deterministic or
  safety failure.
- It does not make agent-authored validators a release authority in v1.
- It does not add peak-context, effective-prompt, or historical-child telemetry
  to the harness. Those metrics remain unavailable unless separately designed.

## Existing contracts consumed

The following are shipped contracts, not proposals.

| Contract | Source | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `harness::send` | [`harness/src/functions/send.rs:69`](../../harness/src/functions/send.rs) | Accepts `session_id?`, message, model, provider, idempotency key, session init, and frozen options. `accepted` is always true on success; `merged`, `queued`, and `deduplicated` are present only when true. |
| Prompt strategy | [`harness/src/functions/send.rs:31`](../../harness/src/functions/send.rs), [`harness/src/prompt/mod.rs:18`](../../harness/src/prompt/mod.rs) | `enrich` is the default; `override` replaces the built-in prompt. A scenario must record the selected strategy. |
| `harness::status` | [`harness/src/functions/status.rs:12`](../../harness/src/functions/status.rs) | Returns current turn/status/counters/children/queue/result, or JSON `null` for an unknown session. It does not return a transcript. |
| `session::messages` | [`session-manager/src/functions/messages.rs:10`](../../session-manager/src/functions/messages.rs) | Returns the active path oldest-first with cursor pagination; the evaluator follows `next_cursor` to completion. |
| Lifecycle IDs and filters | [`harness/src/events.rs:26`](../../harness/src/events.rs) | IDs are `harness::turn-started`, `harness::turn-completed`, and `harness::message-queued`; binding filters accept only `session_id?` and `parent_session_id?`. |
| Completion payload | [`harness/src/events.rs:310`](../../harness/src/events.rs) | Includes session/turn/status/timestamp plus optional `result`, `result_error`, `reason`, parent, and reactive depth. It is not a full transcript or `TurnRecord`. |
| Event fan-out | [`harness/src/events.rs:7`](../../harness/src/events.rs) | `Void` delivery is at-least-once and unordered. Durable status and transcript are the recovery authority. |
| `harness::stop` | [`harness/src/functions/stop.rs:12`](../../harness/src/functions/stop.rs) | Accepts session id and optional turn id, cascades to live children, and returns whether a non-terminal turn is stopping. |
| Public/internal boundary | [`harness/src/functions/mod.rs:32`](../../harness/src/functions/mod.rs) | `harness::turn` and `harness::function::{trigger,resolve}` are internal loop plumbing. |
| Usage and cost | [`harness/src/types/message.rs:39`](../../harness/src/types/message.rs) | Persisted assistant messages can supply tokens and cost. Peak context is not persisted in the turn record. |
| Browser evidence | [`browser/src/functions/mod.rs:42`](../../browser/src/functions/mod.rs) | Current APIs use `browser::*`; proposed `validation::browser::*` functions are adapters, not aliases for shipped functions. Console/network reads include cursor and dropped-entry semantics. |

The harness status fields named `validation_retries` count output-contract repair
attempts. Evaluator feedback cycles use `cycle` and must not reuse that term.

## Architecture and lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant L as CLI / CI
  participant E as harness-eval
  participant H as harness
  participant S as session-manager
  participant V as validator

  E->>H: bind turn-completed handler at worker startup
  L->>E: harness-eval::start(manifest)
  E->>E: persist run + attempt before send
  E->>H: harness::send(idempotency_key)
  H->>S: persist transcript and terminal state
  H-->>E: turn-completed (notification)
  E->>H: harness::status(session_id)
  E->>S: session::messages(all pages)
  E->>V: ValidationRequestV1
  V-->>E: ValidationResultV1
  alt required checks pass
    E->>E: run held-out graders and publish report
  else open validator fails and cycle budget remains
    E->>H: harness::send(same session, feedback, next idempotency key)
  else error, deadline, cancellation, or budget exhausted
    E->>E: publish non-pass report
  end
```

The worker registers one unfiltered completion handler before accepting runs.
It ignores events whose `(session_id, turn_id)` do not match a running attempt.
This avoids the race between a fast turn and per-run binding. A periodic
reconciler polls every non-terminal attempt, so a missed callback cannot strand
a run.

## Proposed worker surface

All types in this section are **Proposed**. They use `protocol_version: "1"`,
deny unknown fields, and publish JSON Schema through normal iii registration.

| Function | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `harness-eval::start` | `StartEvaluationRequestV1` | `{ protocol_version: "1", run_id, status: "running" }` |
| `harness-eval::status` | `{ protocol_version: "1", run_id }` | `EvaluationStatusV1` |
| `harness-eval::report` | `{ protocol_version: "1", run_id }` | `EvaluationReportV1`; error until terminal |
| `harness-eval::cancel` | `{ protocol_version: "1", run_id, reason? }` | `{ protocol_version: "1", run_id, cancelled }`; idempotent |
| `harness-eval::artifact::put` | `ArtifactPutRequestV1` | `ArtifactRefV1`; evaluator and validators only |
| `harness-eval::artifact::get` | `ArtifactGetRequestV1` | `ArtifactGetResponseV1`; evaluator and validators only |

interface ArtifactGetRequestV1 {

}
```

The start request is a tagged union: exactly one of `scenario` or `comparison`
is present. A comparison is one run, not a reference to an already completed
baseline. For pair `n`, the evaluator derives one bit from
`SHA-256(randomization_seed + ":" + n)`; an even low bit runs baseline first
and an odd low bit runs candidate first. The two legs run consecutively before
the next pair. This produces a reproducible interleaved schedule, and the
schedule is persisted before the first attempt starts.

Result aggregation uses one precedence everywhere: `error` if any required
result is `error`; otherwise `fail` if any is `fail`; otherwise
`inconclusive` if any is `inconclusive`; otherwise `pass`. The same rule folds
required validators into a cycle, cycles into an attempt, and attempts into a
run. Therefore every required validator in every attempt must pass for the run
to pass. Validators with `required: false` are advisory and never affect the
aggregate, but their result and advisory label remain in the report.
Exhausting a declared subject budget is `fail`; an evaluator, fixture,
provider, or validator dependency failure is `error`; explicit cancellation is
`state: "cancelled"` with `result: "inconclusive"`; and an evaluator invariant
failure is `state: "failed"` with `result: "error"`.

Stable bus errors use `code: message` text with these codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `harness-eval/invalid_manifest` | Schema, range, function policy, or dependency declaration is invalid |
| `harness-eval/run_not_found` | No durable run exists for the supplied id |
| `harness-eval/run_not_terminal` | A final report was requested before terminal state |
| `harness-eval/budget_exceeded` | A declared time, token, cost, attempt, or cycle budget ended the run |
| `harness-eval/dependency` | Harness, transcript, validator, browser, trace, or artifact dependency failed |
| `harness-eval/internal` | Evaluator state or invariant failure |

Cancellation looks up every running attempt and calls `harness::stop` with both
its session and turn id. It records the stop response, continues reconciliation
until the attempt is terminal, and makes repeated cancel calls harmless.

## Proposed scenario manifest

The launcher reads strict YAML and sends its JSON representation. References are
resolved and digested before `harness-eval::start`; the worker receives frozen
content, not mutable local paths.

```ts
interface ScenarioV1 {
  protocol_version: "1"
  id: string
  description: string
  subject: SubjectV1
  fixtures: FixtureSpecV1
  dependencies: DependencySpecV1[]
  validators: ValidatorSpecV1[]
  limits: LimitsV1
}

interface SubjectV1 {

}
```

```

The evaluator lowers a subject to `harness::send` without adding defaults:

| Scenario field | `harness::send` field |
|---|---|
| `message` | `message` |
| pinned `model` / `provider` | `model` / `provider` |
| session identity | omit `session_id` on cycle 1; use the returned `session_id` on later cycles |
| deterministic cycle digest | `idempotency_key` |
| `system_prompt.content` | `options.system_prompt` |
| `system_prompt.strategy` | `options.system_prompt_strategy` |
| each `options` member | same-named `options` member |

Fixture capability IDs are resolved before the first send. The evaluator adds
only the resolved subject functions to `options.functions.allow`; a requested
function not declared by the fixture or dependency list makes the manifest
invalid. It then snapshots the registered request and response schemas and
stores their digests as the function-catalog digest.

Current harness defaults are resolved again on every new `harness::send`, so a
multi-cycle evaluation cannot truthfully promise to preserve omitted values.
A scenario with `continuation: "explicit_override"` must set an `override`
system prompt and explicitly provide every `options` field shown above,
including `functions`; the evaluator reuses those exact values on every cycle.
A scenario that relies on an omitted option or the built-in prompt must declare
`continuation: "single_cycle"`, set `max_cycles: 1`, and cannot request
`continue_with_feedback`. The manifest validator enforces these rules.

## Proposed fixture and validation protocols

Fixture setup and teardown use these **Proposed** schemas:

```ts
interface FixtureSetupRequestV1 {
  protocol_version: "1"
  run: { run_id: string; scenario_id: string; attempt: number; leg: "single" | "baseline" | "candidate" }
  profile: string
  idempotency_key: string
}

interface FixtureSetupResultV1 {
  protocol_version: "1"
  namespace: string
  setup_digest: string
  capabilities: FixtureCapabilityV1[]
  validator_context: Record<string, unknown>
  evidence: ArtifactRefV1[]
}

interface FixtureCapabilityV1 {
  id: string
  kind: "function" | "browser_session" | "state_namespace" | "database_namespace"
  reference: string
  access: "read" | "write" | "read_write"
}

interface FixtureTeardownRequestV1 {
  protocol_version: "1"
  run: { run_id: string; scenario_id: string; attempt: number; leg: "single" | "baseline" | "candidate" }
  namespace: string
  setup_digest: string
  reason: "completed" | "cancelled" | "failed"
  idempotency_key: string
}

interface FixtureTeardownResultV1 {
  protocol_version: "1"
  cleaned: boolean
  evidence: ArtifactRefV1[]
}
```

Setup runs once per attempt before `harness::send`, using the digest of
`harness-eval:v1:setup:<run_id>:<leg>:<attempt>` as its idempotency key. The
worker persists the request and result before exposing any capability. It
rejects a result whose capability IDs do not exactly cover the manifest lists.
The subject receives only `subject_capability_ids`; validators receive only
`validator_capability_ids`. Teardown runs after validation and before final
publication, with an equally deterministic key. Setup failure is `error` and
does not send a subject turn. Teardown failure is `error`, prevents green, and
retains the namespace and evidence for cleanup. Recovery repeats either call
with the same key.

Every validator implements the same **Proposed** request and response schemas.
The maximum inline response is 1 MiB. Evidence bodies are exchanged through
the artifact functions and returned by reference with a SHA-256 digest. Default
timeout is 60 seconds, bounded by the scenario attempt deadline.

```ts
interface ValidationRequestV1 {
  protocol_version: "1"
  run: { run_id: string; scenario_id: string; leg: "single" | "baseline" | "candidate"; attempt: number; cycle: number }
  subject: { session_id: string; turn_id: string; trace_id?: string }
  validator: { id: string; version: string; mode: "provided" | "agent_authored" }
  fixture: {
    namespace: string
    setup_digest: string
    capabilities: FixtureCapabilityV1[]
    context: Record<string, unknown>
  }
  artifacts: ArtifactAccessV1
  parameters: Record<string, unknown>
  transcript_ref: ArtifactRefV1
}

interface ValidationResultV1 {
  protocol_version: "1"
  run: { run_id: string; scenario_id: string; leg: "single" | "baseline" | "candidate"; attempt: number; cycle: number }
  subject: { session_id: string; turn_id: string }
  validator: { id: string; version: string }
  status: "pass" | "fail" | "error" | "inconclusive"
  checks: Array<{
    id: string
    passed: boolean
    expected?: unknown
    actual?: unknown
  }>
  feedback?: string
  evidence: ArtifactRefV1[]
  metrics: { duration_ms: number; input_tokens?: number; output_tokens?: number; cost_usd?: number }
  error?: { code: string; message: string }
}

interface ArtifactRefV1 {
  uri: string                     // run-relative URI
  media_type: string
  sha256: string
  bytes: number
}

interface ArtifactAccessV1 {
  read_function_id: "harness-eval::artifact::get"
  write_function_id: "harness-eval::artifact::put"
  access_token: string
}
```

Artifact access tokens are random, attempt-scoped, validator-scoped
capabilities. `put` accepts only a token's run and writes a content-addressed
run-relative URI; `get` accepts only URIs granted to that token and verifies
the stored digest before returning bytes. Tokens are never put in the subject
prompt, transcript, metadata, function catalog, or artifact. The evaluator
revokes them after the validator call. The artifact functions are denied to the
subject even if its allow pattern is broad.

`fail` means the subject missed an objective. `error` means the validator or
dependency broke. `inconclusive` means evidence cannot support a decision.
Missing traces, provider outage, browser `dropped > 0`, malformed results, and
validator timeouts are never converted to subject passes.

Validators run in manifest order. The required/advisory aggregation rule in the
worker contract determines the cycle, attempt, and run result. Advisory
failures remain visible but do not change that result.
A held-out validator never contributes function metadata, schema, prompt text,
or feedback to the subject. Only an open validator with
`continue_with_feedback` may create a new cycle.

## Durable state and recovery

The evaluator is the single writer for these records:

```text
harness_eval_run/<run_id>
harness_eval_attempt/<run_id>/<leg>/<attempt>
harness_eval_fixture/<run_id>/<leg>/<attempt>
harness_eval_cycle/<run_id>/<leg>/<attempt>/<cycle>
harness_eval_event/<run_id>/<leg>/<attempt>/<cycle>/<turn_id>
```

`run_id` is random and opaque. Attempt and cycle numbers are monotonic. The send
idempotency key is the SHA-256 digest of
`harness-eval:v1:<run_id>:<leg>:<attempt>:<cycle>`. The event checkpoint key makes
identical completion deliveries no-ops; conflicting terminal payloads produce
`harness-eval/internal` and preserve both payloads as evidence.

The worker persists a cycle before sending. After restart it handles these
states deterministically:

| Durable state | Recovery action |
|---|---|
| Setup request exists, result missing | Repeat fixture setup with the same idempotency key |
| Setup persisted, no cycle | Validate capabilities, then create cycle 1 |
| Cycle exists, no send identity | Repeat `harness::send` with the same idempotency key |
| Session/turn known, non-terminal | Poll `harness::status` until deadline |
| Terminal status, validation missing | Fetch all transcript pages and run validators |
| Validation persisted, continuation missing | Apply the recorded decision once |
| Attempt terminal, teardown missing | Repeat teardown with the same idempotency key |
| Final report persisted | Return it; never rerun validators implicitly |

Continuation waits for terminal status, reuses the same `session_id`, resends
the fully explicit pinned model/provider/options and `override` prompt, appends
the open validator feedback as a new user-visible evaluation message, and uses
the next deterministic idempotency key. It never calls `harness::turn` or
mutates the transcript directly. Scenarios that rely on any current harness
default are single-cycle, as required by manifest validation.

## Isolation, permissions, and trust

A `run_id` is correlation, not enforcement. CI uses a dedicated engine stack
and isolated data directories. Each fixture adapter must prove its own tenant,
database, filesystem, browser-session, and state-key isolation before it can be
shared between scenarios.

- Subject function policy explicitly denies `harness-eval::*` and
  `eval-private::*`.
- Evaluator and held-out grader credentials are not inherited by subject
  workers or shell processes.
- Validators are read-only by default. Active browser validators declare and
  record every action before a separate read-only assertion.
- Artifact writers redact authorization headers, provider credentials, cookies,
  personal data, and environment secrets before persistence.
- Agent-authored validators run only in disposable, secret-free stacks and
  cannot be the sole release gate in v1.
- Attempt wall-clock, cycle, and attempt-count limits are hard: the evaluator
  refuses to start work beyond them, calls `harness::stop` at the deadline, and
  reconciles to a terminal state. Token and cost usage is visible only after a
  model turn; browser and network counts are visible only after an adapter
  action. They are post-turn/action soft ceilings and may overshoot by one
  bounded turn or action. The evaluator checks them before starting the next
  unit, records the overshoot, and never calls them hard limits.

## Metrics and comparison policy

| Dimension | Source | Version 1 status |
|---|---|---|
| Required outcome checks | Validator results | Gating |
| Terminal reliability and cycles | Evaluator run record | Gating/diagnostic |
| Transcript turns and function calls | `session::messages` | Reported |
| Input/output/cache/reasoning tokens and cost | Persisted assistant usage | Reported |
| Wall time and validator duration | Evaluator and message timestamps | Reported separately |
| Trace/span failures | Observability backend when available | Diagnostic; absence is non-green only when scenario requires it |
| Peak context, effective prompt, historical child count | Not durably exposed today | Unsupported in v1 |

Subject cost and time are separate from validator/grader overhead. Comparison
eligibility requires identical scenario description, fixture, dependencies,
validators, limits, and attempt count. Only `subject` may differ between the
baseline and candidate; each complete manifest and subject snapshot has its own
digest in the report. Reports show raw candidate/baseline deltas. Required or
safety failures are disqualifying and cannot be offset by lower latency or
cost. No weighted composite score gates a release in v1.

Real-model release thresholds are introduced only after repeated runs establish
variance. Comparison attempts use the persisted pair-block schedule defined by
`ComparisonEvaluationStartV1`; model and provider identifiers, prompt digests,
function catalog digests, and worker versions are frozen in the report.

## Artifact layout

```text
target/harness-eval/<run_id>/
  manifest.json
  report.json
  stack.json
  attempts/<attempt>/
    cycles/<cycle>/
      send-request.json
      send-response.json
      status.json
      transcript.json
      lifecycle-events.json
      validators/<validator-id>.json
      evidence/
  logs/
```

CI publishes `report.json` for every run. Full evidence and logs are uploaded
for non-pass runs with 14-day retention. Successful verbose artifacts may be
discarded after the compact report and referenced digests are verified.

## Initial scenario corpus

Start with a small diagnosable corpus:

| Family | Required outcome |
|---|---|
| Plain response | Durable final text with no duplicate assistant entry |
| Single function | Allowed target executes once and its result reaches the next generation |
| Parallel functions | Independent calls finish without loss or duplication |
| Sub-agent fan-out/fan-in | Children complete and the parent waits for all required results |
| Persistent workflow | External records match processed fixture items exactly |
| Browser workflow | URL, DOM, network, console, and screenshot evidence agree |
| Recovery | A dependency failure is surfaced and bounded rather than hidden |
| Prompt comparison | Candidate and baseline use identical frozen inputs and report raw deltas |

Subjective model or visual graders are added only when deterministic state
cannot express the objective. They remain advisory until calibrated against a
human-reviewed set with false-positive/false-negative measurements.

## Verification and acceptance

The evaluator implementation must cover:

- JSON Schema/golden catalog tests for every proposed function and type;
- strict manifest rejection, prompt-strategy mapping, and function-policy tests;
- duplicate, conflicting, missing, and out-of-order completion events;
- restart after run persistence, after send, during validation, and before
  report publication;
- same-session continuation with deterministic idempotency;
- validator timeout, malformed response, oversized response, and missing
  evidence classifications;
- hidden-grader catalog isolation and prompt-injection attempts;
- browser cursor/drop handling, secret redaction, hard deadline cancellation,
  and one-turn/action soft-ceiling overshoot;
- deterministic report serialization and candidate/baseline eligibility.

The first prototype is successful when a real-model attempt completes through
public harness boundaries, a provided validator can fail then pass after one
bounded feedback cycle, a held-out validator remains invisible to the subject,
and no required validator or evaluator infrastructure failure can produce
green. Advisory validator failures remain visible but do not gate green.

## Delivery sequence

1. Publish strict scenario, validator, status, and report schemas.
2. Implement the durable evaluator record and `start/status/report/cancel`.
3. Add global completion handling, reconciliation, idempotency, and restart tests.
4. Add one deterministic state validator and one held-out validator.
5. Add local artifacts, redaction, budgets, and CI collection.
6. Run a small real-model corpus without release gating to characterize noise.
7. Add browser evidence and calibrated subjective graders only where needed.
