/**
 * The streaming contract every ChatBackend honors. The order is:
 *   (thought-start ... thought-token* ... thought-end)?
 *   (fcall-start ... fcall-end)*
 *   (assistant-token+ ... assistant-end)?
 *
 * Aborts may interrupt at any token boundary; the consumer's `finally` is
 * responsible for closing out streaming flags. Errors that aren't aborts
 * surface either as a thrown exception or as an `fcall-end` payload whose
 * `output` carries the error shape (caller-defined).
 *
 * See PLAYGROUND.md for the full contract.
